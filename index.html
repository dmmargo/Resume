						<div class="name">Finding new opportunities</div>
						<div class="role">Personal Statement</div>

					</div>
					<div class="text">I graduated from Cal Poly Pomona in May 2020 with a degree in 
					Computer Science. Though I initially majored in International Business, I discovered 
					my passion for engineering and design after attending a campus hackathon at the end 
					of my first year. During the hackathon, I met three other students to work on an ambitious 
					project: a virtual reality game. We initially had little knowledge of designing virtual 
					reality games. But together, we learned new programming languages and concepts that helped 
					us accomplish our goal. Not only did I present our game to judges, but I also shared it 
					with students majoring in different fields to gain different perspectives on the project. 
					Collaborating with my group and sharing my work with others made me realize that I enjoyed 
					leading teams of individuals from various backgrounds.</div>
					<br>
					<div class="text">My interest in leadership culminated in my senior year when 
					I enrolled in a class called “Software Engineering.” Here, I was assigned the 
					role of project manager for my team. By drawing upon my experience in front-end, 
					back-end, business analytics, and qualitative analytics projects, I was able to 
					partition my team’s workloads in the most efficient manner possible while also 
					ensuring that they were involved in every step of the project.</div>
					<br>
					<div class="text">In addition to my schoolwork, I was involved with numerous 
					student clubs at Cal Poly Pomona. I engaged in many activities; a role of which
					I am particularly proud was my role as a Welcome Week Mentor, where for two 
					summers I mentored and informed new students of the clubs, classes, and benefits 
					the school offers while working with club leaders to coordinate plans. I was also 
					the co-vice president and historian of the Computer Science Society, where I learned 
					to manage resources, recruit club interns, and assist the club board with duties. 
					Additionally, I was an intern and a secretary for the Bronco Esports club. 
					I developed methods to efficiently host events of 500 attendees, worked with sponsors 
					to provide students with giveaways, and worked with the campus organizations to book 
					the appropriate rooms. I believe that school clubs are ideal spaces for networking and 
					learning new skills, where students can express themselves in a welcoming and constructive 
					communities.</div>
					<br>
					<div class="text">Before long, I would discover opportunities for applying my leadership 
					and management skills in the real world. During my third year at Cal Poly Pomona, I began 
					an internship at Southern California Edison (SCE) as an IT Summer Intern. During that time, 
					I created and presented a project for the Intern Project Fair and X-Change Program. 
					My X-Change project premiered in the Continuous Improvement Recognition Event. Soon, 
					I was promoted first to a year-round intern, and then to a full-time employee. For the 
					past two years, I have collaborated on many projects and have managed access controls as 
					well as the company’s subdivided SharePoint, which hosts around 400 users. I also help other 
					teams as an individual contributor. To this day, I continue to learn new concepts and am eager 
					to learn more about my capabilities.</div>
