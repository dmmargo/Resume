						<div class="name">Finding new opportunities</div>
						<div class="role">Personal Statement</div>
					</div>
					
					<div class="text">I graduated from Cal Poly Pomona with a degree in 
					Computer Science. Though I initially majored in International Business, I discovered 
					my passion for engineering and design after attending a campus hackathon at the end 
					of my first year. During the hackathon, I met three other students to work on an ambitious 
					project: a virtual reality game. We initially had little knowledge of designing virtual 
					reality games. But together, we learned new programming languages and concepts that helped 
					us accomplish our goal. Not only did I present our game to judges, but I also shared it 
					with students majoring in different fields to gain different perspectives on the project. 
					Collaborating with my group and sharing my work with others made me realize that I enjoyed 
					leading teams of individuals from various backgrounds.</div>
					<br>
					<div class="text">My interest in leadership culminated in my senior year when 
					I enrolled in a class called “Software Engineering.” Here, I took on the 
					role of project manager for my team. Based on my past project experiences, working on front-end, 
					back-end, business analytics, and qualitative analytics projects, I was able to 
					partition my team’s workloads in the most efficient manner possible while also 
					ensuring that they were involved in every step of the project. I made sure
					to bring out the best of their ability while being a team player.</div>
					<br>
					<div class="text">In addition to my schoolwork, I was involved with numerous 
					student clubs at Cal Poly Pomona. I engaged in many activities; a role of which
					I am particularly proud was my role as a Welcome Week Mentor, where for two 
					summers I mentored and informed new students of the clubs, classes, and benefits 
					the school offers while working with club leaders to coordinate plans. I was also 
					the co-vice president and historian of the Computer Science Society, where I learned 
					to manage resources, recruit club interns, and assist the club board with duties. 
					Additionally, I was an intern and a secretary for the Bronco Esports club. 
					I developed methods to efficiently host events of 500 attendees, worked with sponsors 
					to provide students with giveaways, and worked with the campus organizations to book 
					the appropriate rooms. I believe that school clubs are ideal spaces for networking and 
					learning new skills, where students can express themselves in a welcoming and constructive 
					communities.</div>
					<br>
					<div class="text">Before long, I would discover opportunities for applying my leadership 
					and management skills in the real world. During my third year at Cal Poly Pomona, I began 
					an internship at Southern California Edison (SCE) as an IT Summer Intern. During that time, 
					I created and presented a project for the Intern Project Fair and X-Change Program. 
					My X-Change project premiered in the Continuous Improvement Recognition Event. Soon, 
					I was promoted first to a year-round intern, and then to a full-time employee. For the 
					past two years, I have collaborated on many projects and have managed access controls as 
					well as the company’s subdivided SharePoint, which hosts around 400 users. I also help other 
					teams as an individual contributor. To this day, I continue to learn new concepts and am eager 
					to learn more about my capabilities.</div>
					<br>
					<div class="text">Looking back on my college and professional career, I am 
					more certain than ever that I am best suited for management and leadership 
					roles. My goal is to become a project manager and, perhaps one day, a manager.
					To achieve this goal, I will continue to seek projects that allow me 
					to demonstrate my problem-solving skills to my co-workers and leaders. 
					By applying my strategic management skills, I aim to create 
					better problem-solving solutions and help as many colleagues as 
					possible achieve their own goals. </div>

					<div class="role">Tell me about yourself</div>
					<div class="text">Hi, my name is Diane, and I'm an IS Security Associate 
					at Southern California Edison. At work, I specialize in vulnerability, patch, 
					and access management. I also help out with QA testing, the evidence review board, and 
					systems security management ports and services.
					</div>
					<div class="text">Outside of work, I've had the opportunity to  
					work on my own side projects and learn new and different skills, such as SQL, 
					Forescout, and Blazer.					
					</div>
					<div class="text">I'll always be happy to learn more about any opportunies that 
					come my way as long as it's after my work hours.  
					</div>
					<div class="text">😀😀😀

					<br>

					<div class="role">What is your greatest strengths?</div>
					<div class="text">I think some of my greatest strengths is my communication and willingness 
					to take initiative. During my work, I've ran into situations where I would take a role in helping 
					the team with different tasks. I communicated with different teammates to ensure the task was 
					done correctly by listening to their feedback and doing task way ahead of their deadlines to 
					give room for any improvements. Because I worked with mroe and more people, I ended up joining 
					7 different teams in my own team learning almost end-to-end as only an intern, 
					which carried over when I got converted to a full-time employee.
					</div>
					<br>
					
					<div class="role">What is your greatest weakness?</div>
					<div class="text">I'd have to say that public speaking. I've been 
					presenting more at my workplace and have been enjoying presenting at bigger meetings since they make 
					me feel more confident. All of the experiences has made it easier  t for 
					me to speak with a bigger crowds of people and to explain, for example, the requirements our 
					team needs to meet. I'm still working on it, of course. 
					</div>
					<br>
					
					<div class="role">What is your greatest professional achievements?</div>
					<div class="text"><i>Situation:</i> Several people reported a problem with the 
					Grid SharePoint to me. Once I saw the web address, I was able to recongize 
					the issue and quickly found a workaround. I recognized that URLs the users 
					were trying to access were no longer redirecting to the new SharePoint 2019 
					that my team and upgraded to earlier in that year. </div>
					<div class="text"><i>Task:</i> My role was to manage the site and email 
					the Grid Team of the issue right away while SMEs and I troubleshooted 
					the site's backend. </div>
					<div class="text"><i>Action:</i> I worked with the SMEs on the backend and 
					QA the access and link to the page that broke as we tried to find 
					different solutions to solve the conflict until noon, when we found one. </div>
					<div class="text"><i>Result:</i> By sharing the work around, I was able to 
					get Grid SharePoint users back up in running within minutes! I alleviated 
					hundreds of calls to the help desk and down work for many of the users who 
					access the SharePoint site and management escalation.

					<!--
					<div class="role">Why do i deserve the scholarship?</div>
					<div class="text">I believe my previous accomplishments as an IS Security Associate and the skills I have learned on the job make me deserving of this scholarship. I have led two different clubs and contributed to many hackathons and in-class group projects before entering the field, where I learned how to manage resources, worked with people inside and outside of the clubs/groups, and organized events up to 500 attendees. 

					Before long, I would discover opportunities for applying my leadership and management 
					skills in the real world. During my internship at Southern California Edison (SCE) as 
					an IT Summer Intern, I created and presented a project for the Intern Project Fair and 
					X-Change Program. My X-Change project premiered in the Continuous Improvement Recognition 
					Event. Soon, I was promoted first to a year-round intern, and then to a full-time employee. 
					For the past two years, I have collaborated on many projects and have managed access controls as well as the company’s subdivided SharePoint, which hosts around 400 users. I also help other teams as an individual contributor. To this day, I continue to learn new concepts and am eager to learn more about my capabilities.</div>
